Introduction
============


This python module lets you do CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) with Relatics through a SOAP 1.1 connection.

.. warning::  The python module is still in beta phase. It has been written for Python 3.x, but is being rewritten to work with both Python 2.5+ and Python 3.x


In order for this module to work, the following module is a **prerequisite**:

    * `suds <https://fedorahosted.org/suds/>`_

For now, the following can be done:

    * Read data
    * Create/Update an Element
    * Delete an Element
